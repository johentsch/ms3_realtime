_Video_: Live demonstration

_Top_: score annotations temporally aligned with audio (each vertical span is labeled with an annotation, notice the labels names above the audio profile)

_Bottom_: original score added to follow the music and the annotations precise location during live visualizing

(higher quality to see the labels names more clearly: ![here](images/live_viz_K309-2.mp4))

## Intro

This repository proposes a pipeline to perform the alignment between an audio recording of a piece present in DCML Mozart sonatas corpus [1], using Sync Toolbox dynamic time warping (DTW) tools [2].

The project was conducted at the Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab at EPFL led by Prof. Martin Rorhmeier and supervised by Dr. Steffen Herff.

## Content

- **aligner.py**: script to perform alignment with the command line interface described below
- **utils.py**: module containing the alignment functionalities
- **examples**:
  - notes and labels TSV files from the piece K309, movement 2, downloaded from DCML Mozart sonatas corpus [1]. You can reproduce the alignment with them by providing a version you own of an audio recording of K309-2 to the command line interface.
  - example of a CSV result output
- **playground_notebook.ipynb**: notebook that details the alignment pipeline, gives suggestions on how to adapt it to data outside the Annotated Mozart Sonatas corpus and shows how to evaluate the accuracy of the alignment result.

## Prerequisites
### Package requirements

Check the `requirements.txt`.

### First-time setup

* clone this repo
* (optional but recommended) create and activate a new environment
    * e.g. a conda environment: `conda create -n ms3 python=3.10 && conda activate ms3`
* install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to activate the correct environment before executing any of the commands below.

### Dataset preparation

First, download the [Annotated Mozart Sonatas corpus](https://github.com/DCMLab/mozart_piano_sonatas/tree/update) (from the *update* branch).

Second, install the [`ms3` parser](https://github.com/johentsch/ms3), navigate to the top level of the *mozart_piano_sonatas* repository and generate the notes and labels files
needed for audio-to-annotation alignment by running:

`python ms3 extract -N [folder_to_write_notes_file_to] -X [folder_to_write_labels_file_to] -q`

This will provide additional quarterbeats information needed for alignment.

## Tutorial

### Command line

Once the files locations are all identified, you can run:

`python aligner.py -a [audio_WAV_file] -n [notes_TSV_file] -l [labels_TSV_file] -o [CSV_file_to_write_results_to]`

This default command line will store a CSV file with minimal information i.e. labels and corresponding timestamps,
useful to visualize (e.g. with *SonicVisualiser*).

[options to be detailed]

### Playground notebook

A notebook is provided to give a detailed understanding of the aligning pipeline. It allows one to see the behaviour of the pipeline's steps independently, visualize some steps, and shows how the pipeline could be adapted to data outside the *Annotated Mozart Sonatas* dataset.


### Results visualization

#### Visualize labels alignment

For labels visualization purposes, only the `compact` mode is needed when running `aligner.py`. 

1. Open *SonicVisualiser* and open the audio file used for alignment.

2. Then, click on `File/Import Annotation Layer` (`Ctrl+L`)and open the alignment result CSV file.

3. Identify columns and their heading category: *time* for `start` and *label* for `Label`. Make sure to check "First row contains column headings".

4. You can change display settings in the *Property Boxes* of the right pane with `View/Show Property Boxes` (`X`). For example, select *Segmentation* for *Plot Type* of the annotation layer.

5. Open the score in *Musescore*. Opening both *SonicVisualiser* and *Musescore* side by side, you can follow the temporal alignment of labels on the audio and the score at the same time.

#### Visualize notes (score following-like mode) [to be added]

## Deriving timelines from aligned notes

This section explains how to generate a `.beatgrid.csv` file that can be imported into TiLiA,
the [Timeline Annotator](https://tilia-app.com/) software.

What you need:

* have followed the [first-time setup](#first-time-setup) above
* a MuseScore file of the piece in question
* an audio recording, possibly one in the public domain so that it can be shared
    * first stop: [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/)
    * [Creative Commons Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/)
    * [MusOpen](https://musopen.org/) (requires log-in)
    * [archive.org](https://archive.org/)
    * [Musical Heritage Organization](https://pool.musicalheritage.org)

### Prepare the data

We need to extract an unfolded notes TSV from the MuseScore file, which we can achieve with ms3:

    ms3 extract -a -N <target> -u -i <regEx>

* `-a` stands for all (without this flag, ms3 will ignore all files that are not listed in a
  `metadata.tsv` file)
* `-N`, optionally followed by the target directory where to store the notes TSV file(s)
* `-u` stands for unfolded, i.e., with expanded repeats
* `-i` for including only files that match the regular expression; leave out to process all
  MuseScore files in the current directory and all subdirectories

Problems will arise if the recordings do not reflect the repeat structure of your score (e.g.,
a musician does not actually repeat a section that is repeated in the score). The easiest way to
address a mismatch might be to manipulate the MuseScore file until it reflects the recording's
music flow before extraction.

If you want to batch process multiple pieces, you need to create a CSV file mapping notes TSV files to audio files. The
column names are (order irrelevant):

* `audio`: path to an audio file
* `notes`: path to a notes TSV file
* `name`: (optional) name of the output file(s). Column can be missing or have values for only some of the pieces.

You can either store absolute paths or relative paths that resolve correctly against your current working directory at
processing time.

### Align notes with recording and derive timeline(s)

You're now set up to create one `.beatgrid.csv` file per piece that you can import in TiLiA as a beat
timeline. The command is:

    python aligner.py -a audio.mp3 -n piece_unfolded.notes.tsv -tla

* `-a` is the (absolute or relative) path to the audio file
* `-n` is the (absolute or relative) path to the notes TSV file
* `-tla` tells the script to create a `.beatgrid.csv` file
* optionally, you can pass `-o <target>` to choose where to create the file(s)

If you are batch processing multiple files, replace the arguments `-a` and `-n` with
`-c batch.csv`, specifying the (absolute or relative) path to the mapping CSV file
(see previous section), e.g.:

    python aligner.py -c batch.csv -tla

### Create a TiLiA file

* in an empty file
* load the audio recording
* create a beat grid with an arbitrary beat pattern (e.g. `4`) -- (this step will not be necessary in the future)
* follow the [TiLiA documentation](https://tilia-app.com/help/import) to import the corresponding
  `.beatgrid.csv` file as a beat timeline.
* save the file

## Notes and leads of improvement

- Notes or labels TSV files may contain unexpected additional fields
  - Solution: 
    - identify them all and add them to `utils.py/align_warped_notes_labels`
    - rewrite `utils.py/align_warped_notes_labels` so that it is less (or not) sensitive to columns lists
- Has not been tested for pieces containing repetitions
  - Solution:
    - Test for repeating pieces (should not give conclusive results, if not raising errors)
    - Investigate DTW improvements as proposed in *Automatic Alignment of Music Performances with Structural Differences* [3]
- Provide function to compute a similar running index as the AMS's `quarterbeats` (and corresp. `duration_qb`), for data that would only contain bar and beat within a bar positions and time signature
